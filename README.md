In this notebook tutorial, we delve into the fascinating realm of learned data compression. 

Traditional data compression techniques like ZIP, RAR, and gzip have long been the backbone of file compression, but with the advent of deep learning and neural networks, there's a new frontier in compression: learned data compression. 

In this tutorial, we'll explore the concepts, techniques, and implementations behind learned data compression, offering a hands-on approach to understanding this cutting-edge technology.

* Goal: lossy data compression
* Challenge: Trade-off between rate and distortion

      rate: the expected number of bits needed to encode a sample
      distortion: the expected error in the reconstruction of the sample.
      Note: in Lossless, we only have rate

* dataset: MNIST
* Method : "END-TO-END OPTIMIZED IMAGE COMPRESSION"
